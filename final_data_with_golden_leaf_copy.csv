During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch. Additional curb inlets and reinforced concrete pipe will be installed to support the design. City and other funds will be used to improve the existing farm ditch which currently collects runoff.

Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City.

The town will use Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds to perform necessary field data collection and performance modeling of existing watersheds, map the location and condition of stormwater assets, and develop concept plans and alternatives that will allow the town to identify and prioritize improvement options and create opinions of probable cost. Development of a stormwater master plan will serve the entire town, though modeling and improvements will focus on three sub-watersheds that drain into Jennie's Gut, Perquimans River, and Lakers Creek. Frequent flooding around Stokes, White, and Front streets make stormwater improvements in these areas a priority.

An existing sewer line could also be undermined causing failure resulting in loss of services as well as wastewater entering the channel. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to replace the existing damaged culvert. The project will include removal of the failing corrugated metal pipe and replace it with reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The culvert will be extended upstream of the crossing. The extension will provide protection to the adjacent sewer line. Downstream of the culvert crossing, two driveway culvert crossings will be abandoned in place and the new RCP installed with tie-in to the proposed headwall.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report.

This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan.

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project. There are households located in the immediate project areas, with additional households in the neighborhood that will also benefit from reduced flooding after completion of Phase II. This project will also reduce flooding on a primary road through the development. ",Town of River Bend,Local Government,Infrastructure,3/14/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022,6/2/22,250000,250000,River Bend

The flooding can take up to 2 weeks to fully dewater. In 2020, the city completed a multiphase feasibility study to create the Duffyfield Resiliency Improvement Initiative. Retrofitting of the stormwater pump station on Rose Street was identified as one of the projects to reduce repetitive flooding in this area. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to modify the existing stormwater pump to allow for better mitigation against larger storm events and lowering the water levels in the Duffyfield community. The city is currently pursuing funding from the NC Land and Water Fund, the NC DOJ Environmental Enhancement Grant, and a Resilient Coastal Communities Grant to implement strategies identified. There are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and a healthcare facility that are in the immediate project area that will benefit from this project. ",City of New Bern,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/30/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022,10/6/22,249760,249760,New Bern

Streets and residential properties in the area are often left flooded for extended periods of time. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install infrastructure to enclose the ditch and improve drainage to eliminate flooding in the area. An exposed water line running along the slope of the ditch will be abandoned and water services will be reconnected to existing water lines located upstream. Households and vehicles traveling on adjacent roads in the immediate project area will benefit from this project.,Town of Tabor City,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/10/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022,8/4/22,175000,175000,Tabor City
