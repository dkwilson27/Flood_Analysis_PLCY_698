Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

This road is the only way in and out of southern Surf City and serves the entirety of Topsail Beach. A feasibility study of the overall stormwater issues along South Shore Drive developed a specific solution to address the issue. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install a catch basin with drain pipe to convey stormwater to a new infiltration chamber system that collects and releases stormwater back into native soils.

The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events.
