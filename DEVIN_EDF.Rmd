## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
setwd('/Users/devinwilson/Documents/EDF/Flood_Analysis_PLCY_698')
getwd()
golden_leaf <- read_csv('golden_leaf.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
golden_leaf <- golden_leaf %>% clean_names() %>% filter(!is.na(city_town)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(grant_award))

write.table(golden_leaf, file="golden_leaf.csv", sep=",")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
golden_leaf %>% ggplot(aes(x=total_percent_of_land_at_some_level_of_flood_risk, y=county_name, fill=city_town)) + xlim(0, 100) + labs(y = "County", x = "Percent of Land at Flood Risk", title = "Percent of Land at Flood Risk in each County", subtitle = "Communtities Which Recieved Funding") + geom_col(show.legend = TRUE)
```

```{r}
golden_leaf %>% ggplot(aes(y=county_name, x=grant_award, fill = grant_award)) + labs(y = "County", x = "Grant Award in Thousands", title = "Grant Awarded to Each County") + theme_classic() + geom_col()
```
